    <h3>Violet Flowers</h3>
    <p>"I kept wondering why I was tired and thirsty all the time, then I began using Track Yourself to record my water intake. I realized I was only drinking an average of 4 cups of water a day! Now that I'm drinking 8 cups of water a day I no longer feel thirsty all the time"</p>

    <h3>Barry Snoozer</h3>
    <p>I'm always complaining to my friends about how tired I am. Violet suggested I try using Track Yourself to track my sleep. After entering in my sleep times for a few weeks, I was surprised to learn I was only sleeping an average of 3 hours a night. I'm going to keep recording my sleep times with a goal of getting a least 6 hours a night.</p>
